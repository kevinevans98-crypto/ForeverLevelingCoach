Important routing rule
----------------------
Forever can contain multiple quests with the same title, so route logic uses
unique quest IDs rather than quest names.

Route-data policy
-----------------
Do not invent quest IDs or coordinates. New route steps and waypoint data
should be added only after they are verified for WoW Forever.

Current verified route anchor
-----------------------------
The first automatic-routing anchor is the Horde Shaman Call of Water chain.
The route database currently includes verified quest IDs 2986, 1534, and 1536.

Roadmap
-------
- Expand the verified Horde Shaman 21-30 route first
- Add navigation arrow / waypoint destinations using verified coordinates
- Backfill levels 1-20
- Add worthwhile dungeon quest logic
- Add beginner-friendly macros
- Add gear scanning and upgrade recommendations
- Add community feedback/export tools
